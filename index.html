            <p></p>
            <h1>Who We Are?</h1>
            
            <p>Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester is a registered 
            charity dedicated to preserving and promoting Slovak language and culture. 
            We provide Slovak language education and organize cultural and community activities
            to help Slovak-speaking families maintain their heritage while living abroad.</p>
            
            <p>While our primary focus is on supporting Slovak-speaking children and families,
            we warmly welcome anyone interested in learning the Slovak language and engaging with 
            our traditions. Beyond our Saturday school, we offer various workshops, events, and social 
            activities where individuals of all ages can connect, learn, and take part in our cultural community.</p>
			
			

            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            
            <p>Our mission is to: At Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester,
            our mission goes beyond just teaching the Slovak language. We are here to keep our 
            heritage alive, to ensure that children growing up abroad don’t lose their connection to
            their roots, and to create a place where Slovak culture thrives—even far from home.</p>

            <p>We believe that language is more than just words; it carries identity, history,
            and a sense of belonging. Through our work, we bring Slovak-speaking families together,
            helping them build friendships, strengthen their cultural ties, and feel at home even while 
            living in the UK.</p>
            
            <p>Education is at the heart of what we do, but our purpose extends even 
            further. We are here to bridge the gap between the UK and Slovak education systems, ensuring that 
            children who may one day return to Slovakia can transition smoothly. We are here to support families, 
            guide them, and make sure no one feels lost when navigating life between two countries. 
            Above all, we are here to create a community—one that welcomes, supports, and celebrates Slovak language, 
            traditions, and the people who cherish them.</p>
			
			


            <h1>Our Journey</h1>

            <p>Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester was founded by a group of dedicated
            teachers who shared a common vision—to establish a Slovak educational and cultural centre
            that truly makes a difference.

            With a passion for teaching, culture, and community-building, 
            we worked tirelessly to create a space where Slovak families could access quality 
            education and cultural activities.</p>

            <P>After months of hard work, we were proud to become a registered charity on 9th September 2024,
            marking a significant step in our journey. Our official launch on 15th September was a proud moment, 
            celebrated in collaboration with the Faculty of Education from Univerzita Mateja Bela and the Association of Slovak Schools and 
            Community Centres in the UK.
            Since then, we have continued to grow, supporting Slovak-speaking families, students, 
            and individuals who wish to learn, connect, and celebrate Slovak culture together.</P>
