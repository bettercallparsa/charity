           <h1>Events & Projects</h1><br><br>
           <p></p>
           <p>At Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester, we believe that Slovak culture should be experienced, not just learned. That’s why we organise a variety of events for everyone—families, children, adults, and individuals who simply want to connect with Slovak heritage, make new friends, and enjoy great company.
            <br><br>
            Whether you’re a parent wanting to engage your child in Slovak traditions, a single professional looking to expand your social circle, or someone who just loves Slovak culture,
			our variety of events and workshops provides a welcoming space where people
			can enjoy themselves, have fun, eat traditional Slovak food, and build lasting connections.
            Some come for the cultural experience, some come to practise their Slovak, and others just come to enjoy good company over a coffee or a glass of wine. Whatever your reason, you are always welcome.</p>

            <h1>Upcoming Events</h1>
            <p>Join us for our upcoming events—come with friends or come alone; you’ll always find a warm and friendly group to welcome you.</p>

            <h1>Easter Workshop (6th April)</h1>
            <p>Step into the world of Slovak Easter traditions at our Easter Workshop, where culture, creativity, and community come together for a fun and welcoming afternoon.
            This hands-on event will offer something for everyone—families, individuals, and anyone who enjoys arts, crafts, and festive traditions. Join us in decorating eggs using traditional Slovak techniques, creating beautiful Easter crafts, and learning about the unique customs that make Slovak Easter so special.
            <br><br>               
            But this event is more than just a workshop—it's also a social gathering where you can meet new people, enjoy great company, and experience a warm community atmosphere. Whether you're coming with friends, family,
			or on your own, you’ll find a friendly, relaxed environment where connections happen naturally over delicious Slovak food and drinks.
			
            To make the afternoon even more special, we will have music playing throughout the event and, if all goes to plan, we hope to welcome a special guest.
            Come along, get creative, and celebrate Slovak Easter traditions in a fun and social setting! More details on our socials (add Facebook page and Instagram links)</p>
